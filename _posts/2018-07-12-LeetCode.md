## Tips

### Two Pointers
- Think about the conditions to move pointer, when to move pointers with regard to other neccesary actions.
- Normally `while l < r:`. Don't write `while` in this `while` loop.

### Conditions (`if`, `else`)
- Decouple conditions whenever possible, don't write nested ones.
- Pay attension to variables in conditions that are changed in previous conditions. Either use `else` or make a copy of the original value.
